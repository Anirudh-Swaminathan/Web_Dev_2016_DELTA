## This is the task given for Delta Web Dev-2016
### Overview
> The aim was to recreate the dinosaur game of google chrome.
<br/>
> The game made by me has 2 control keys:- 
* SPACE - For starting the game and jumping
* P -  For Pausing and resuming the game
<br/>
> The game has two types of Obstacles:-
* Cactus
* Bird
<br/>
> The aim of the game is to survive for the longest time, without hitting any of the obstacles
<br/>
> The scores are calculated based on the amount of time spent running. The highscore for the session is also shown after the 1st and every subsequent run.
<br/>
> The *speed* of the dinosaur increases as time progresses, and the distance between the obstacles also decreases.
<br/>
> The game can be reloaded just by pressing the canvas after the game has ended.
